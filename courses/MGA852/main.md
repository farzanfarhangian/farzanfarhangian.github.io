# Air navigation, GNSS and on-board inertial systems (MGA852): Fall 2022

## Course Description
At the end of this course, the student will be able to:

distinguish the different air navigation guidance systems as well as their principles, methods and architectures;
apply fundamental concepts in the operation of navigational instruments and essential communications between these instruments;
to synthesize an inertial navigation system and to formulate the various calculations including the spatial orientation (attitude) of a mobile;
analyze and synthesize problems in air navigation.
Geodetic reference systems and celestial mechanics. Fundamentals of geopositioning and aircraft guidance. Guidance and radio navigation instruments. Modeling and simulation of navigation instruments inside a screen dashboard. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS): principles of American GPS, European Galileo, Russian Glonass, Chinese Compass and augmented systems. On-board inertial navigation: inertial sensor technologies (accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, electronic compass), geodetic coordinate systems (reference transfer), inertial navigation algorithms. Integrated and on-board navigation: design of hybrid systems by modelling, experimental simulation and analysis.

Practical work sessions: modeling and simulation of guidance and radio navigation instruments within a flight management system, an inertial navigation system and a hybrid navigation system.

ATTENTION regarding fraud and plagiarism: The HEC Montreal has a strict policy in case of fraud or plagiarism. If an infraction is found, the professor is required to report to the director of the department. An administrative procedure is then automatically triggered with the following consequences: the offense is noted in your file, and a sanction is decided (which can be serious and go to dismissal in case of recidivism). It is important that you do the work yourself!
