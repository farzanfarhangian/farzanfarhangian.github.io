# Trustworthy Machine Learning (MATH80630): Fall 2022

## Course Description
Welcome to  Graduate level course on Trustworthy Machine Learning at HEC Montreal (English edition). This course will teach students to recognize where and understand why ethical issues and policy questions can arise when applying data science to real world problems. It will focus on ways to conceptualize, measure, and mitigate bias in data-driven decision-making.

This is a graduate course, in which we will cover methods for trustworthy and ethical machine learning and AI, focusing on the technical perspective of methods that allow addressing current ethical issues. Recent years have shown that unintended discrimination arises naturally and frequently in the use of machine learning and algorithmic decision making. We will work systematically towards a technical understanding of this problem mindful of its social and legal context. This course will bring analytic and technical precision to normative debates about the role that data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence play in consequential decision-making in commerce, employment, finance, healthcare, education, policing, and other areas. Students will learn to think critically about how to plan, execute, and evaluate a project with these concerns in mind, and how to cope with novel challenges for which there are often no easy answers or established solutions.

## Time & room

## Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of machine learning will be assumed. 
Mathematical maturity and basic knowledge of statistics, and probability will be assumed. 
For the programming assignments and the project, Python programming will be assumed. If you do not know Python here are few ways to learn the basics below. 

- [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/onboarding/create_account?track_id=17): Complete Chapters 1, 2, 3 (sign in using this [link](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/d8833e84f66e8de38ca3de07987087f93561cfd2b03a636c6d0156a699e8de50) with your @hec.ca email address to access Chapters 2 and 3). **This option is recommended**
- [HEC CAM]() offers introductory python courses in September (currently only in French). Register at [CAM registration](https://inscription.hec.ca/cams/).

## Grading
Your final score for the course will be computed using the following weights:

- [Active in-class participation](lectures.md) (10%)
- [Paper review](assingment.md) (15%)
- [Paper presentation](assingment.md) (15%)

ATTENTION regarding fraud and plagiarism: The HEC Montreal has a strict policy in case of fraud or plagiarism. If an infraction is found, the professor is required to report to the director of the department. An administrative procedure is then automatically triggered with the following consequences: the offense is noted in your file, and a sanction is decided (which can be serious and go to dismissal in case of recidivism). It is important that you do the work yourself!
