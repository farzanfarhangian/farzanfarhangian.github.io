## Research Assistant and Professional Researcher at École de technologie supérieure ÉTS, Montréal

I received my M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering Department at [École de Technologie Supérieure (ETS)](http://www.etsmtl.ca/) under supervision of [Professor Rene Jr. Landry](https://rlandry.etsmtl.ca/?lang=en). Before that, I was graduated from Shahid Chamran University of Iran in Power and Control Engineering in 2015 and obtained my first Master in 2018 in Navigation, Guidance and Control. From 2014 to 2019, I worked on robotics, navigation, and control system projects. Due to my experiences and advanced knowledge in C/C++, Python, Embedded systems, PNT and Signal Processing, I decided to join [LASSENA](http://www.lassena.etsmtl.ca/) laboratory from January of 2020. My research interests include but not limited to INS, AHRS, Kalman filtering, Indoor/outdoor positioning, Doppler positioning and satellite navigation, GNSS, Embedded systems and software-designed radio receiver. In LASSENA, I am recently working on signals of opportunity (SOP) and designing inertial software defined GNSS receivers (SDR) for obtaining the robust and resilient results (PNT) of navigation in inertial navigation systems as an alternative positioning and timing solution in non-GNSS environments. I also work on designing a novel avionic Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) in the NextGen project, contributing with well-known avionics companyies in Canada. After my graduation in LASSENA, I started to contribute as a research assistant actively working on NextGen avionics and Nesiva projects. I could develop integrated navigation systems using various LEO satellites like; Iridium, Orbcomm, Globalstar and Starlink as an augmentation in Nav-SOP indoor and outdoor applications. Currently, I am an Embedded systems Developer in GEOTAB in kinematics and automotive team working on interesting navigation, orientation estimation and firmware solutions.
